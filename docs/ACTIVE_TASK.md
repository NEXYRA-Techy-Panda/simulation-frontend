# ACTIVE_TASK — simulation-frontend

## Layer ID

F1

## Objective

Define shared contract v1.0.0 (canonical in simulation-backend, mirrored to
siblings) with known-answer fixtures and dependency-free verification.
Design only — no application code.

## Task status

blocked

## Review status

pending

## Repository and owner

- Repository: `simulation-frontend` (`https://github.com/NEXYRA-Techy-Panda/simulation-frontend.git`)
- Foundation owner (F0–F6): Mohan. Long-term owner: Kishore Kumar (after F6 handoff).

## Current branch

`main` (verified; commit + push authorised by F1)

## Last checkpoint timestamp, including timezone

2026-09-24 18:29:39 +05:30 (IST) — F1 contract work complete and verified;
commit/push BLOCKED on missing git identity (asked twice, no values supplied).

## Applicable contract version

1.0.0 (defined; mirror under `contracts/v1/`, canonical in
simulation-backend).

## Completed steps

1. Continuity startup + F0.1 preservation + Python verification (3.13.15,
   64-bit, pip 26.2.1, SQLite 3.50.4 at supplied path).
2. Contract mirror received: CONTRACT.md, dataset.schema.json,
   CSV_COLUMNS.md, API.md, fixtures (reference.json/csv, expected.json),
   manifest.json, scripts/verify-contract.mjs, .gitignore.
3. Verified `node scripts/verify-contract.mjs` → 49/49 in all five repos.
4. Continuity docs: HANDOFF §0 F1 addendum (+dated Python/read-only/hosting/
   git-policy corrections), prompt push-policy update, README contract links,
   docs/F1_EVIDENCE.md.
5. Staged-file inspection: only task-owned files
   (.gitignore, README.md, contracts/, docs/, scripts/). No secrets, DBs,
   venvs, or dependency dirs.

## Files changed

- Created: `contracts/v1/` (7 files), `scripts/verify-contract.mjs`,
  `.gitignore`, `docs/F1_EVIDENCE.md` (docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md etc. from
  F0/F0.1 also previously untracked — all committed together as reviewed
  foundation).
- Created in F1: `docs/ACTIVE_TASK.md` updates, `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md` entries.
- Updated in F1: `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/AGENT_START_PROMPT.md`, `README.md`.
- Preserved: `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/WORKSPACE_MAP.md`.

## Verification performed and actual results

- Verify script 49 passed / 0 failed in all five repos (final re-run after
  doc edits). Semantic checks only; formal schema validation is F2.
- Mirror hash step passes here against the canonical manifest.
- No application scaffolding, installs, migrations, training, servers, or
  deployment (artifact scan clean).

## Incomplete edits and uncommitted changes

- None incomplete. All files to be committed now with message
  "docs: establish foundation and v1 data contracts".

## Blockers or unknowns

- BLOCKED: no git user.name/user.email. Staged commit in simulation-backend
  failed (exit 128, "Author identity unknown"). Mohan asked twice; no identity
  strings supplied, so none configured and none invented. No commits exist;
  push auth untested. Remediation: configure identity, `git add` (index is
  stale after blocker-entry edits), commit, push per repo, verify hashes.

## Exact next action

Mohan: configure git identity, then per repo `git add`, commit ("docs:
establish foundation and v1 data contracts"), `git push -u origin main`,
verify remote hashes; then return F1 evidence for architecture review;
do not begin F2 until its prompt is supplied.

## Related-repository dependencies

Canonical contract in `../simulation-backend`; no cross-repo runtime
dependency. Siblings: 4000/3001/4001/8000. This repo's port: 3000.

## Commit reference

To be recorded in the F1 evidence report after push (no hash loop in docs).
